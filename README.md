# AI surveillance Robot


This project presents an AI-powered surveillance robot with a 2-wheel differential drive system and a caster for stability. The robot is 3D-printed for a customizable and potentially low-cost design.

## Key Features:

* **3D Printed Design:** The robot leverages 3D-printed parts, offering potential for customization and replicability.
* **Gazebo Simulation:** Initial development and testing are conducted within the Gazebo robot simulator. This facilitates safe experimentation and debugging . 
* **Computer Vision Optimization:** Bandwidth is optimized to ensure efficient processing for the robot's computer vision tasks. This optimization ensures smooth operation and real-time performance for the robot's vision system in.
* **Object Detection:** *The robot can identify specific objects within its field of view using computer vision algorithms. 
* **Line Following:** The robot can seamlessly detect and follow lines on a track, enabling autonomous navigation. This enables the robot to navigate predefined paths accurately.
